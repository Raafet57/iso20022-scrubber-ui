0014: Executive Summary
0015: Overview
0016: This document outlines the product requirements for a suite of five micro-tools designed to address specific pain points in Financial Operations (FinOps) and Payment processing. These tools tackle the complexity inherent in ISO 20022 messaging standards, which have become the global standard for financial messaging but present significant usability challenges for operations teams.
0017: The core value proposition follows a proven formula: take complex XML/JSON standards, filter out technical noise (headers, signatures, metadata), and present only the business-critical information (amounts, parties, dates, reasons) in human-readable formats.
0018: Strategic Context
0019: ISO 20022 adoption is accelerating globally with SWIFT's CBPR+ migration, the Federal Reserve's FedNow implementation, and TARGET2 modernization in Europe. A single payment message can exceed 500 lines of XML code, creating operational bottlenecks for teams who must manually interpret these messages for investigations, compliance reviews, and exception handling.
0020: These micro-tools are positioned as lightweight, web-based utilities that require no integration—operations staff can immediately gain value through simple copy-paste workflows. This approach enables rapid deployment and viral adoption within financial institutions.

0040: Product 1: ISO 20022 Narrative Generator
0041: Codename: "The Storyteller"
0042: 1.1 Problem Statement
0043: Operations analysts and customer support agents struggle to quickly understand the "story" of a payment file. Reading raw XML tags (<UltmtDbtr>, <Cdtr>, <Purp>, <RmtInf>) requires mental translation from technical nomenclature to business meaning. This cognitive overhead leads to slower response times on customer inquiries, potential misinterpretation of payment intent, increased training burden for junior analysts, and higher error rates during peak processing periods.
0044: A typical cross-border payment in pacs.008 format contains 150-300 data elements. An analyst investigating a single payment may need to mentally parse debtor information, creditor details, intermediary banks, charge bearers, regulatory reporting codes, and unstructured remittance information—all encoded in nested XML hierarchies.
0045: 1.2 Target Users
0046: Primary: L1/L2 Payment Operations Support staff handling customer inquiries and payment investigations
0047: Secondary: Compliance Officers reviewing flagged transactions for AML/KYC purposes

0049: 1.3 Value Proposition
0050: Instantly converts complex ISO 20022 XML into a natural language paragraph, reducing cognitive load and investigation time by an estimated 40%. Enables junior analysts to understand payment context without deep technical training, accelerates customer response times, and reduces interpretation errors.

0091: 1.8 User Stories
0092: US-1.1: As an L1 support agent, I want to paste a pacs.008 XML and immediately see who is paying whom, so that I can answer customer calls faster.
0093: US-1.2: As a compliance analyst, I want to understand the purpose of a flagged payment in plain English, so that I can determine if further investigation is warranted.
0094: US-1.3: As a new team member, I want to toggle between narrative and bullet-point views, so that I can learn the payment structure while getting work done.
0095: Product 2: Smart XML Anonymizer
0096: Codename: "The Scrubber"
0097: 2.1 Problem Statement
0098: When payment processing fails, operations and engineering teams need to share XML logs with external parties for debugging: SWIFT support desks, core banking vendors (FIS, Temenos, Finastra), payment processors, or developer communities (Stack Overflow, GitHub Issues). However, production payment files contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) including customer names and addresses, International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), national identifiers (SSN, Tax IDs), and transaction amounts that may reveal sensitive business relationships.
0099: Current workarounds are problematic. Manual redaction is time-consuming, error-prone, and often breaks XML structure. Generic find-replace corrupts validation (e.g., replacing an IBAN with "XXXX" creates an invalid IBAN that fails mod-97 checksum validation). Sharing unredacted files violates GDPR, CCPA, and internal data governance policies.
0100: 2.2 Target Users
0101: Primary: Implementation Managers coordinating with vendors during go-live
0102: Secondary: QA Engineers creating test cases from production failures
0103: Tertiary: Developers debugging integration issues in non-production environments
0104: 2.3 Value Proposition
0105: Enables safe sharing of production payment data by intelligently scrubbing sensitive information while preserving structural integrity and validation logic. Reduces debug cycle time from hours to minutes while maintaining regulatory compliance.
0106: 2.4 Functional Requirements (MVP)
0107: 2.4.1 Smart Masking Engine
0108: The system shall detect and replace the following data types while maintaining format validity:
0109: Data Type
0110: Detection Method
0111: Replacement Strategy
0112: Personal Names
0113: XML tag context (<Nm>)
0114: "Person A", "Person B", etc.

0117: "Company A", "Company B"
0118: Addresses
0119: <PstlAdr> structure
0120: "123 Test Street, Anytown, XX 12345"
0121: IBANs
0122: Regex + mod-97
0123: Valid dummy IBAN (passes checksum)
0124: Account Numbers
0125: <AcctId> tags
0126: Same-length randomized digits
0127: Transaction IDs

0129: Preserve format, randomize content
0130: 2.4.2 Consistency Mode
0131: If an entity (e.g., "John Smith") appears in multiple locations within the XML (Debtor Name, Remittance Information, Related Party), all instances shall be replaced with the same pseudonym ("Person A") to maintain referential integrity and debugging context.
0132: 2.4.3 Preservation Rules
0133: The following elements shall NOT be anonymized:
0134: BIC/SWIFT codes (bank identifiers are not PII)
0135: Error codes and status codes

0159: US-2.2: As a QA engineer, I want to generate test data from production failures, so that I can reproduce issues in our test environment.
0160: US-2.3: As a developer, I want the anonymized file to still pass XML schema validation, so that I can run it through our parsing logic without modification.
0161: Product 3: Payment Chain Visualizer
0162: Codename: "The Map"
0163: 3.1 Problem Statement
0164: Cross-border payments traverse multiple financial institutions before reaching the beneficiary. In ISO 20022 messages (particularly pacs.008 and pacs.009), the chain of banks is encoded in deeply nested XML structures: Instructing Agent (InstgAgt), Intermediary Agent 1-3 (IntrmyAgt1, IntrmyAgt2, IntrmyAgt3), and Creditor Agent (CdtrAgt). Each agent block contains BIC codes, LEIs, clearing system identifiers, and branch information.
0165: During payment investigations, analysts must manually trace this routing to answer questions like: "Which bank has my payment right now?" and "Why did the payment route through Singapore when it was supposed to go direct?" This requires mentally parsing nested XML while cross-referencing BIC directories—a time-consuming process prone to errors.
0166: 3.2 Target Users
0167: Primary: Payment Investigations Teams tracking stuck or delayed payments
0168: Secondary: Liquidity Managers understanding nostro/vostro relationships
0169: Tertiary: Correspondent Banking teams analyzing routing efficiency
0170: 3.3 Value Proposition
0171: Transforms complex agent chains into intuitive visual flowcharts, enabling instant comprehension of payment routing. Reduces time-to-insight for investigations from 15+ minutes of manual XML analysis to under 30 seconds.
0172: 3.4 Functional Requirements (MVP)
0173: 3.4.1 XML Parser
0174: Extract all agent BICs from the payment chain:
0175: Debtor Agent (DbtrAgt)
0176: Instructing Agent (InstgAgt)
0177: Intermediary Agent 1, 2, 3 (IntrmyAgt1/2/3)
0178: Creditor Agent (CdtrAgt)
0179: Instructed Agent (InstdAgt)
0180: 3.4.2 BIC Enrichment
0181: For each BIC code, resolve via external API (SWIFT Ref Data or open BIC directory):
0182: Full institution name
0183: Country (with flag emoji/icon)
0184: City
0185: Institution type (Commercial Bank, Central Bank, etc.)
0186: 3.4.3 Visualization Engine
0187: Generate left-to-right flowchart using D3.js or React Flow:
0188: Nodes: Rectangular boxes with bank name, BIC, and country flag
0189: Edges: Directional arrows labeled with settlement method (COVE = Cover Payment, INGA = Interbank Gross Amount, INDA = Interbank Net Amount)
0190: Highlighting: Optional color-coding for different clearing systems (TARGET2, CHIPS, Fedwire)
0191: 3.4.4 Time Analysis (Phase 2)
0192: If timestamps available in header (CreDtTm) and settlement (SttlmDt), display estimated "time in flight" between each hop.
0193: 3.5 Success Metrics
0194: Time to Insight: Reduction in time to identify intermediary banks (target: < 30 seconds vs. 15+ minute baseline)
0195: User Engagement: Diagram export rate (PNG/PDF) > 25% of sessions
0196: Accuracy: BIC resolution accuracy > 99%
0197: 3.6 User Stories
0198: US-3.1: As a payment investigator, I want to see a visual map of the bank chain, so that I can quickly identify which intermediary is causing a delay.
0199: US-3.2: As a liquidity manager, I want to understand our correspondent banking relationships visually, so that I can optimize routing for cost and speed.
0200: US-3.3: As a client service rep, I want to export a visual diagram, so that I can include it in customer communication about payment status.
0201: Product 4: Legacy-to-Rich Translator
0202: Codename: "The Rosetta Stone"
0203: 4.1 Problem Statement
0204: The financial industry is in the midst of a multi-year migration from SWIFT MT (Message Type) formats to ISO 20022 MX formats. Senior operations staff, correspondent banking experts, and treasury professionals have decades of experience with MT103, MT202, MT940, and other legacy formats. They intuitively know that "Field 50K" contains ordering customer information or that "Field 71A" specifies charge details.
0205: When confronted with ISO 20022's verbose XML structure (<DbtrAcct><Id><IBAN>), these experts struggle to locate equivalent information. This knowledge gap creates training costs exceeding $10,000 per employee for comprehensive ISO 20022 certification, reliance on outdated MT knowledge during the transition period, friction in cross-generational team collaboration, and slower adoption of enhanced ISO 20022 features.
0206: 4.2 Target Users
0207: Primary: Banks undergoing CBPR+ migration (SWIFT's Cross-Border Payments and Reporting Plus initiative)
0208: Secondary: Corporate Treasurers receiving ISO 20022 statements from their banks
0209: Tertiary: Training departments creating migration documentation
0210: 4.3 Value Proposition
0211: Bridges the knowledge gap between legacy MT and modern MX formats by providing a side-by-side "translation" view. Acts as both an educational tool and a practical reference utility, accelerating migration adoption while preserving institutional knowledge.
0212: 4.4 Functional Requirements (MVP)
0213: 4.4.1 Split-View Interface
0214: Left Pane: Input area for ISO 20022 XML (pacs.008, pacs.009, camt.053)
0215: Right Pane: Generated "Virtual MT" representation (MT103, MT202, MT940 equivalent)
0216: 4.4.2 Field Mapping Engine
0217: Implement comprehensive field mapping based on SWIFT's official MT-MX mapping guidelines:
0218: MT103 Field
0219: ISO 20022 Path
0220: Description
0221: :20: (TRN)
0222: CdtTrfTxInf/PmtId/InstrId
0223: Transaction Reference
0224: :32A: (Value Date/Amt)
0225: IntrBkSttlmDt + IntrBkSttlmAmt
0226: Settlement Date & Amount
0227: :50K: (Ordering Cust)
0228: Dbtr/Nm + Dbtr/PstlAdr
0229: Debtor Name & Address
0230: :59: (Beneficiary)
0231: Cdtr/Nm + Cdtr/PstlAdr
0232: Creditor Name & Address
0233: :70: (Remit Info)
0234: RmtInf/Ustrd
0235: Payment Purpose/Invoice
0236: :71A: (Charges)
0237: ChrgBr
0238: SHA/OUR/BEN

0241: Unique End-to-End Reference
0242: 4.4.3 Interactive Highlighting
0243: Hover or click on any XML element to highlight the corresponding MT field (and vice versa). Tooltip displays: "You are looking at <UETR>, which corresponds to Field 121 in MT format."
0244: 4.4.4 Truncation Warnings
0245: Visually flag data in the ISO 20022 message that would be lost or truncated in MT conversion:
0246: Addresses longer than 4×35 characters (MT limit)
0247: Structured remittance data not representable in unstructured Field 70
0248: Ultimate party information (UltmtDbtr/UltmtCdtr) with no MT equivalent
0249: 4.5 Success Metrics
0250: Feature Engagement: Highlight/hover interaction rate > 60% of sessions
0251: Educational Value: Post-session survey: "Did this help you understand ISO 20022?" > 4/5 rating
0252: Adoption: Return user rate > 40% within 30 days
0253: 4.6 User Stories
0254: US-4.1: As a senior banker familiar with MT103, I want to see where Field 50K appears in ISO 20022, so that I can quickly find ordering customer information in the new format.
0255: US-4.2: As a trainer, I want to demonstrate the enhanced data richness of ISO 20022, so that I can show my team why migration matters.
0256: US-4.3: As a corporate treasurer, I want to understand my bank's new statement format, so that I can update my reconciliation processes.
0257: Product 5: Reject Reason Decoder
0258: Codename: "The Fixer"
0259: 5.1 Problem Statement
0260: When a payment fails, the rejection is communicated via a pacs.002 (Payment Status Report) message. The failure reason is encoded as a four-character code (e.g., "AC03", "AM05", "BE04") buried within <TxSts><Rsn><Cd> tags, sometimes accompanied by cryptic free-text in <AddtlInf>.
0261: Operations teams face multiple pain points: Code lookup requires referencing 50+ page SWIFT or CBPR+ documentation, multiple codes may apply to the same scenario, the rejecting institution (Debtor Agent vs. Intermediary vs. Creditor Agent) context matters, and there's no standard guidance on remediation steps. A single failed payment investigation can consume 30-60 minutes of analyst time, with resolution often requiring multiple iterations of "fix and retry."
0262: 5.2 Target Users
0263: Primary: Exception Handling Teams processing failed payments
0264: Secondary: Client Service Representatives explaining failures to corporate clients
0265: Tertiary: Technical support teams diagnosing integration issues
0266: 5.3 Value Proposition
0267: Instantly diagnoses the root cause of payment rejections and provides specific, actionable remediation steps. Reduces exception resolution time from 30+ minutes to under 5 minutes while improving first-time-fix rates.
